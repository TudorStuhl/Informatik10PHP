Documentation for the Project: „Forum: Forum of ridiculous user’s minds“

The project has the goal to crate a website where different users can ask their ridiculous questions and receive responses to them.

On the website forum users have the ability to create/edit an account, ask questions and respond to them.

Important: access to .json files need to be turned of on the webserver otherwise the database_config will be visible to everyone

The project contains:

1. index.php: main page with most of the functions
2. logout.php: used to logout from index.php, has no other use
3. question.php: page were questions are shown in a larger amount
4. question_logout.php: review logout.php – for the question.php
5. index.css: stylesheet for the index.php
6. question.css: stylesheet for the question.php
7. ajax.php: to send requests to the database without reloading the page
